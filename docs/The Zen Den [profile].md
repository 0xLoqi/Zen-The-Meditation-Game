✨ Profile Screen — “Zen Den” (Re-imagined from first principles)

Zone	Purpose	Key elements	Monetization hooks
1. Hero Pane	Instant emotional connection	- Full-body Mini Zenni rendered over subtle animated backdrop (last equipped Aura).
- Tap Zenni → opens “Change Look” bottom-sheet (Outfit, Headgear, Aura tabs).	- “New!” badge on tabs with un-equipped cosmetics.
- Glowbag icon top-right showing unread count.
2. Progress Ring	Showcase growth & habit strength	- Circular ring encircling Zenni: inner gradient fills with XP toward next level
- Tiny flame icon + streak count under ring.	- When streak breaks, ring grays out → subtle “Restore Streak (20 Zen Tokens)” tooltip.
3. Stats & Badges Bar	Bragging rights, social proof	- Horizontal scroll of unlockable Achievement badges (tap to view requirements).
- Friend count chip (tap → Friends screen).	- Locked badges show silhouette → “How to unlock” sheet nudges meditation / quests.
4. Customize Tiles	Fast access to monetizable personalization	- Outfit, Headgear, Aura tiles (thumbnail + “Edit”).
- Companion tile (shows current or “Add Companion”).	- If user lacks companions, “Shop Companions” opens premium catalog filtered by rarity >= rare.
5. Zen Tokens & Glowbags Row	Currency & loot overview	- Left: Token balance pill with “+” icon (opens token purchase IAP).
- Right: Mini Glowbag carousel (common→legendary) with counts.	- Empty legendary slot grays out with tooltip “Upgrade to Zenni Plus for daily legendary Glowbag”.
6. Daily Quest Panel	Engagement driver	- Card shows today’s 3 quests with progress bars.
- “Claim” buttons light up when complete.	- Completing all quests surfaces a Rare Glowbag (keeps user on the loop).
7. Settings & Subscription Footer	Control & upsell	- Compact row: ⚙️ Settings • ❓ Help • 🌟 Zenni Plus.
- Zenni Plus button gradient-outlined; opens paywall.	- If user is Plus, footer shows “Zenni Plus Active” with renewal date & manage link.
Color & Visual Language
Earth-tone background (#FFF8E9) for warmth and brand consistency.

Neutral cards (#FFFFFF with 8 px elevation) avoid visual noise.

Accent gradients match equipped Aura color, keeping the screen feeling “alive” to the user’s choices.

Rounded corners (16 px) and soft shadows to maintain a calming vibe.

UX Flow Highlights
One-tap personalization: user taps their Zenni → instantly swaps cosmetics without navigating away.

Monetization surfaces but never shouts: token balance and Glowbags present but secondary to Zenni.

Dynamic hero ring turns habit data into a living interface (fills as user levels).

Footer paywall access is always visible but polite; Plus members feel rewarded, non-Plus see clear upgrade path.

Implementing this layout makes the Profile/“Zen Den” feel like the player’s home base—rich with cosmetic expression and subtle but persistent monetization levers that align with user pride rather than disruption.
