🌌 Lore – The World of Zen
✨ The Glow and The Dimming
Long ago, the world shimmered with an energy called the Glow—a subtle but powerful force powered by human presence, inner peace, and connection to the now.

But in the age of hyperstimulation, the Glow began to fade.

Not through malice… but through noise.

The Dimming came slowly:

Doomscrolling replaced stillness

Outrage replaced reflection

Cheeseburgers replaced nourishment

Streaming replaced silence

Each moment we forgot to breathe, the Glow lost strength.

Now, it flickers.

🧙 Who is Zenni?
Zenni is the ancient guardian of the Glow—part spirit, part sage, part trickster monk. For centuries, Zenni slept within the Glow, keeping watch.

But now, as the Dimming grows, Zenni stirs.

He cannot restore the Glow alone. Instead, he calls forth tiny spiritual fragments of himself—embodied pieces of wisdom and play.

They are the Mini Zennis.

🐒 What Are Mini Zennis?
Mini Zennis are sentient companions—playful, curious, silly, or serene. Each one is born with a unique vibe, color, and expression depending on the person they’re paired with.

Every Mini Zenni is summoned by a human seeking balance—often without even realizing it.

They are more than pets or avatars.
They are the bridge between distraction and presence.
Between chaos and calm.
Between “I should meditate” and actually sitting down to do it.

📜 The Summoning
When a user begins their journey, their Mini Zenni is summoned from The Glow—a radiant energy cloud that responds to intention.

The summoning takes place through a portal, drawing from the user’s focus and intentions. The process is magical, mysterious, and slightly different each time.

In that moment, a bond is formed.

The Mini Zenni is the user's guide, reflection, and spiritual sidekick.

The more the user meditates, the more their Mini grows.

And through that growth, the Glow strengthens for everyone.

📚 Comic & Story World Ideas
To reinforce the lore playfully, the world can be revealed via short onboarding comics and recurring in-app stories. Example elements:

Zenni appears from a phone screen, stepping through the barrier between digital and spiritual worlds.

A frazzled human (overworked, stressed, doomscrolling) is gently paired with their Mini.

As they meditate, the world around them subtly transforms—colors brighten, the Mini evolves, and faint Glow returns to the world.

Future stories might involve:

Mini Zennis learning new emotions

Echoes from the Glow (e.g., corrupted Zennis? Shadow creatures?)

Restoring shrines across a broken landscape (gamified narrative)

🎭 Character Seeds (In Progress)
Zenni – The wise monkey guru, both humorous and deeply centered. Always floating or meditating. Sometimes wears silly disguises. Think: Mr. Miyagi meets Uncle Iroh meets your inner child.

Echo – A soft-spoken, mysterious being who appears in clouds and teaches through riddles. Possibly a bridge to hidden features, lore, or daily reflections.

Puffa – A sleepy, puffy Mini Zenni who teaches the importance of rest and dreaming. Could guide users through sleep meditations or rewards for unwinding.

The Glowbags – Loreified lootboxes. Each one is said to be a concentrated fragment of the Glow. Contain gifts, cosmetics, or wisdom from within.
