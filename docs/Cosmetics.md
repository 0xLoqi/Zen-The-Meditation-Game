🎨 Cosmetics System – Zen: The Meditation Game
Overview
Cosmetics in Zen – The Meditation Game are core to motivation, expression, and reward. They're how players:

Personalize their Mini Zenni

Show off their mindfulness streak

Feel progression in a playful, meaningful way

The system is modular, rarity-based, and built around a lore-driven loot mechanic: Glowbags.

🧱 Modular System Structure
Each Mini Zenni can be visually customized with layered cosmetic categories:

Category	Description	Layering
Outfits	Robes, pajamas, onesies, suits	Main body
Headgear	Crowns, hats, headphones, flowers	Top
Auras	Floating visual effects	Behind Zenni
Faces	Expressions and eyes (trait-based)	Swappable
Companions	Pets or floating spirits	Optional side placement
Accessories	Staffs, satchels, totems, masks	Variable
🌀 Rarity Tiers
Tier	Visual Cue	Drop Rate	Description
Common	Light Beige	Frequent	Simple, charming, easy to unlock
Rare	Forest Green	Uncommon	Themed, well-designed, more expressive
Epic	Ocean Blue	Infrequent	Animated or dynamic with motion
Legendary	Warm Gold Glow	Very Rare	Signature, story-tied, ultra-collectible
Each rarity is reflected visually in the Glowbag it comes from (see below).

🎁 Glowbags (Lootboxes)
Glowbags are how most cosmetics are unlocked. They are gift-like bundles powered by The Glow and come in four tiers:

Bag Tier	Visual Style	Contents
Common	Neutral drawstring pouch	1–2 common items
Rare	Green bag with shimmer	1 rare + bonus chance common
Epic	Blue pulsing aura bag	1 epic + chance for rare
Legendary	Golden glowbag with sparkles	1 guaranteed legendary item

⚙️ System Design Notes
Cosmetics do not impact performance—they’re purely expressive.

Players can preview, save favorites, and mix & match.

Assets should be layered SVGs or PNGs for modularity.

Common items = charm. Legendary = lore, awe, and delight.

Use rarity coloring in UI to reinforce desirability.
