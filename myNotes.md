More onboarding stuff - include required breathing and "focus" as part of summoning the mini zenni during onboarding

Regular notification system

Different preferences to hook different types of people, regular "toasts", "loading" screens or bumper screens where we display the value of meditation through preferences, in onboarding we learn about what their motivation is and then serve them personalized reminders that they care about - Nerds, show them science stuff, spritual people, spritutal tooltips, young kids, lean on the story, etc.

Back button on every screen
