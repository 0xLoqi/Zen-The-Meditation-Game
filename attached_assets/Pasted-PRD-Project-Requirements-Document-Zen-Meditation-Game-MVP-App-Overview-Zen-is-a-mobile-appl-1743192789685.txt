PRD (Project Requirements Document) - Zen Meditation Game MVP

App Overview:
Zen is a mobile application designed to make meditation a fun and engaging habit. Users nurture a virtual companion, "Mini Zenni" (a monkey-guru character), by completing daily meditation sessions. The core mechanic involves guided breathing exercises where focus is trained by tracking breath, primarily using thumb movements on the screen. Progress is rewarded with Experience Points (XP) for Mini Zenni, Zen Tokens (in-app currency), and streaks, fostering a connection and encouraging consistent practice. The app introduces gentle spiritual lore centered around Mini Zenni and a greater source, Zenni.

User Flows:

Onboarding: New user signs up via email/password, sets a username. Existing user logs in.
Daily Loop:
User opens app, lands on Home Screen.
User completes optional Daily Check-in (1-5 scale rating, optional reflection).
User initiates a Meditation Session from Home Screen, choosing a type (Calm, Focus, Sleep) and duration (5-10 min).
User performs meditation, tracking breath via thumb movements (up/down) or uses "I Did It" fallback. Receives gentle haptic feedback if off-rhythm.
User views Post-Session Summary (Breath Score, XP/Tokens earned, Streak progress, Micro-lesson).
User sees Mini Zenni potentially level up or receive rewards on returning home.
Customization: User navigates to Wardrobe, browses unlocked outfits, previews them on Mini Zenni, and equips a chosen outfit.
Growth (MVP): User earns Zen Tokens via sessions. User can see a placeholder/teaser for future Guru Mode. User can find and share a basic referral code/link.
